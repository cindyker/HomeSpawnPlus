v1.6.1 -
* made strategies no longer case-sensitive in the configuration
* added "nearestHomeOrSpawn" strategy
* added some extra warnings to hopefully detect configuration issues and reduce the number of support tickets
* added Portuguese translation (locale pt) - thanks @Traki08!
* updated German translation (locale de) - thanks @Jobsti2!
* new event "onNamedSpawnCommand" for controlling named spawn behavior
* new strategies "modeNoWater" and "modeYBounds" for controlling safe spawn and random spawn behavior
* improvements to safe teleport to reduce occurance of non-safe teleports, especially noticeable with random strategies
* added "dynmap.layer.homes.include-bed-home" and "include-named-homes" options (default home is always included)
* implemented player name best matching for several commands (/hlo, /homeo, /hi, /sho). /dho (delete) still requires exact match as a safety measure.

v1.6 - Jun 30, 2012
* added /permcheck command (alias /pc) for checking permissions
* added plugin metrics (from LWC author Hidendra, website http://mcstats.org). Edit "plugins/PluginMetrics/config.yml" and set "opt-out: true" if you wish to opt out of all mcstats reporting.
* Ticket #112: added permission for named spawns. By default this behavior is off, controlled by the "core.spawnNamedPermissions" config option. If enabled, HSP will check for permission: "hsp.command.spawn.named.<spawnname>" in order for the player to have permission to use the named teleport
* Enhancement request: "resetOnDeath" cooldown config option. Can be used per-permission, per-world or in default cooldown sections
* Ticket #114: random world spawn. Added 'spawnWorldRandom' strategy
* Ticket #114: random named spawn. Added 'spawnNamedRandom' strategy
* added "spawnRegionRandom" strategy for spawning at a completely random location inside a worldGuard region
* Ticket #104: /sethome and bedHome don't play nice together
* lots of testing and fixes to dynmap integration (it works now!)
* Ticket #106: fixed the annoying "your home bed was missing or obstructed" message
* Ticket #102: added French localizaton (thanks JohOply!)

v1.5.5 - May 12, 2012
* bugfix (unreported) for MODE_HOME_NO_BED not working
* Ticket #96: home name is "null" message in /homeinvite
* Ticket #98: delete homes with ID
* Ticket #71: bug with singleGlobalHome home limits
* Ticket #51: dynmap integration added (largely untested, looking for testers
& feedback)

v1.5.4.1 - May 5, 2012
* bugfix for an NPE on teleport, reported in comments
* made safe teleporting default to ON, can be disabled in config

v1.5.4 - May 4, 2012
* converted build system over to maven (finally stood up my own nexus
respository required to host dependent artifacts that aren't maven enabled).
This simplifies the build process to git cloning the source and then just
running 'mvn install'. Easy!
* Ticket #95: added time string messages to cooldowns, ie: "32 minutes 25
seconds remaining"
* Ticket #94: safe teleport, now settable via "config.safeTeleport" option
* Ticket #92: bed home request. See new bedHome documentation available at:
http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/homespawnplus/pages/bed-homes/
* localized time strings
* Ticket #89: home cost multiplier

v1.5.3 - April 20, 2012
* Ticket #93: named homes not working
* startup delay resolved. Default 'EBEANS' storage just uses Bukkit ebeans. To
use Persitance Reimplemented (http://goo.gl/rtdDH) which enables live-reload
(among other benefits, check link), you can use PERSISTANCE_REIMPLEMENTED_EBEANS
storage engine, at the cost of a ~0.75 second delay at startup.
* Added startup warnings for anyone using Essentials or CommandBook that also
gives brief instructions for how to make those plugins play nice with HSP.
* Updated Essentials home converter to Essentials 2.9 (most current version).
* Added converter for CommandBook. Since CommandBook can already import
MyHomes and warpz0r, this means users of those plugins can use the CommandBook
converter script and then import that into HSP. link: http://goo.gl/v0a0j

v1.5.2 - April 18, 2012
* Major refactor of strategies. End result if things were done right is
there should be no noticeable change to end users. However, the refactor
includes some performance improvements as well as signficantly more
maintainable code, which also increases the chance others can easily
create and contribute their own strategies.
* fix for home invites sent for homes without a name

v1.5.1 - April 15, 2012
* simplified the /hi command (a suggestion by @Infuscu). The /hi (homeinvite)
command arguments are reversed to now be "/hi player homename", so that if
you only have one home, you only have to type "/hi player".
* in addition, I have added the "id #" of a home to /homelist and modified
/hi to accept an ID, so you can type "/hi player 4" to invite player to your
home with the id #4.
* fixed a localization bug for a homeinvite message
* added "core.bedhome2clicks" option (default: true), which enables or
disables the 2-click requirement for setting a bed home
* added "core.bedHomeMustBeNight" option (default: false) which requires
that it be night time in order to use the bed to save a home (single player
mechanics)

v1.5 - April 15, 2012
* refactored storage subsystem in preparation for home invite feature
* coded full YAML backend on new storage subsystem; storage type YAML for
individual YAML files per object (home/spawn/player) or YAML_SINGLE_FILE for a
large single data file. YAML storage types are cached in memory for fast,
efficient access. You can use the backup/restore feature to backup an existing
SQL database, then convert to YAML and restore if you want to switch.
* Ticket #28: home invite feature enhancement. Local testing works good, but
needs mass-testing so I'm looking forward to feedback on this feature.
* Ticket #77: show MC spawn (use /spawnlist -m)
* added /setmapspawn for changing a map's spawn point (not really useful for
HSP in any way, just a general utility command)
* added /groupquery command for troubleshooting group problems
* added /homelistother command to list other people's homes
* BREAKING CHANGE: old-style permission "hsp.command.xxx.use" no longer works; 
use new-style "hsp.command.xxx" (old-style permission has been deprecated
for a long time now, finally cleaning up the code)

v1.4.4 - never released, merged into 1.5
* fixed WorldGuard compatibility to work with newest WorldGuard 5.5 changes
* added Dutch translation; locale nl (thanks @Dunncann!)

v1.4.3 - March 4, 2012
* fixed a reported bug with new installations throwing DB version upgrade errors
* saved an extra permission check on block place when using 'bedsethome'.
Thanks to @Chrisjon for reporting the issue.
* Ticket #73: HSP throws NPE if World doesn't exist (R6 issue)
* Ticket #74: issue with first spawn when using Bukkit world-container setting, issue fixed for all strategies

v1.4.2 - February 23, 2012
=== <<color green>>v1.4.2 - February 23, 2012<</color>> ===
* This release is compatible with R5 (the new Bukkit event system)
* Ticket #69: Fix Russian encoding (again)
* Fix for WorldEdit error message printed on startup with latest release
versions of WorldEdit (5.2, 5.3 in the future)

v1.4.1 - February 15, 2012
* fixed a bug related to bed homes when using MODE_HOME_BED_ONLY, which
resulted in the bed homes not being used at all
* converted persistence engine to "Bukkit Persistance Reimplemented"
http://goo.gl/c9WjB - the main effect here is that HSP is now friendly to live
reloading using plugins such as PluginReloader, thus it can be live-reloaded
for upgrades or plugin testing (mostly helps me as the developer)
* Ticket #70: first spawn not working correctly
* Ticket #69: Russian encoding wrong (hopefully fixed, need confirmation)

v1.4 - February 10, 2012
* added German locale (de) - thanks Jobsti!
* added Russian locale (ru) - thanks MSTrus!
* "core.newPlayerStrategy" option added and default is changed to BUKKIT which
uses Bukkits Player.hasPlayedBefore() API call. If you have issues with
newPlayer detection not working like you expect you can change this back to
"ORIGINAL", although I suspect most people will prefer the BUKKIT method since
that will depend exclusively on the "player.dat" file, which is how most
people expect new player detection to work.
* Ticket #18: added "modeRequiresBed" to require existence of a bed for other
home strategies in a given strategy chain
* Ticket #64: "price%" showing up when charging players using default english localization

v1.3.1 - January 14, 2012
* finished off localization of strings, HSP strings are now fully localized. Now it just needs translations other than just English!
* fixed a bug with limit cascading (unreported)
* Ticket #47: permission system "op" taking precedence over "superperms"
* Ticket #50: WEPIF not being used when using WorldEdit release 5.0
* Ticket #54: NPE related to HSP localization in /home command
* Ticket #48: Support for /groupspawn group arguments (permission: hsp.command.groupspawn.named)

v1.3 - January 1, 2012
* enhancement, Ticket #22: /homedelete to accept w:world argument
* enhancement, Ticket #29: stuck in chunk hole when teleporting
* enhancement, Ticket #23: i18n (internationalization) support (config option: core.lang)
* added "core.defaultMessageColor" option for changing default message color
* message localization is NOT complete! There are a LOT more strings to be added, I've just gotten the work started (maybe ~25% done).
* will need volunteers for additional langauges. English ("en") is the only one provided at this time.
* BIG BIG thanks to Hidendra (LWC) for letting me adapt his localizaton code for HSP's use

v1.2.2 - December 29, 2011
* Ticket #37/#38/#40: first spawn not working properly
* Ticket #36: SQL CONSTRAINT error due to new player check not working
* Ticket #43: "basic" config being copied into config_defaults.yml
* Ticket #39: NoClassDefError for WEPIF: now prints warning if using old
version of WorldEdit instead
* Ticket #32: implement "group.XYZ" groups for Superperms (code borrowed
from WEPIF)

v1.2.1 - December 25, 2011
* Ticket #33: fixed a bug in some situations with new player checks on
PLAYER_JOIN

v1.2 - December 25, 2011
* Ticket #24/#25/#30: cooldowns per-permission, per-world and per-home
* Ticket #24: warmups per-permission and per-world
* Ticket #24: cost per-permisson and per-world
* Ticket #25: add cooldown for /sethome
* Ticket #25: separate timer for "home-named" and "sethome-named"
* added a "basic" config.yml that is copied in place if none exists. This is a
bit simpler for new users to understand - the "config-defaults.yml" always
contains the full listing of options available.
* added /spawnlist and /spawndelete commands
* added "spawnLocalRandom" strategy for spawning at a random spawn point on
the local world

v1.1.3 - December 19, 2011
* Ticket #31: bugfix for /sethome taking money when player is at home limit

v1.1.2 - December 17, 2011
* Ticket #27: fix permissions for perm systems not supporting superperms
* some code cleanup/refactoring
* The above changes come with a new config option "permissions" which allow
you to select which permission system you want to use. By default it will go
through the list and use the first available, but now you can change it if you
want (for example, maybe you prefer to use WEPIF instead of Vault).

v1.1.1 - December 8, 2011
* fix for HSP throwing NPE when a world has been deleted
* fix for "/homelist <world>" not working properly
* added "onNamedHomeCommand" event type, called when player types "/home
name". New strategy "homeNamedHome" was added to match. This doesn't change
default functionality any, but it allows admins to influence the outcome of a
player typing "/home name" using home modes - for example you could use
"modeHomeNoBed" to disallow players using their bed homes on "/home name".
* added ability for HSP to respond to console commands to "/hsp" (so you can
"/hsp rc" to reload the config from the console, for example)

v1.1 - December 4, 2011
* Ticket #15: fixed a bug with modeHomeNoBed strategy
* Ticket #16: better firstLogin detection, check world/players/player.dat
* Ticket #17: fixed an NPE bug with /groupspawn command if no groupspawn is defined
* Ticket #19: fixed issue with warmups being canceled due to movement detection being too sensitive
* Ticket #13: new feature, config param "homeLimits.singleGlobalHome" to enforce a single global home that always changes when using /sethome (or a bed)
* new permission "hsp.singleGlobalHomeExempt" to be exempt from "singleGlobalHome" restriction
* added WorldEdit WEPIF support, which supports more permission systems for those who have WorldEdit (only used if Vault is not present)
* Fixed permission->world->global spawn strategies so they fall through. Before, if a
perm.onHomeCommand strategy was defined, but not perm.onDeath and a player
died who matched the perm, they would not get the world-specific or global
onDeath like you would expect. This is fixed.

v1.0.2 - November 29, 2011
* fixed permission "hsp.command.sethome.named" to be correct
* added modeHomeBedOnly mode strategy

v1.0.1 - November 27, 2011
* fixed a new SQL-related bug related to setting bed homes

v1.0 - November 27, 2011
* added ability for HSP to have multiple named homes per world (if you give your players access to /sethome)
* added config options to limit the number of homes globally, per-world or per-permission group (defaults to 1 per world, which maintains the same behavior before this feature was added)
* added per-world event control capabilities, so that you can define an event strategy chain that takes place only on a specific world
* added per-permission event control capabilities
* added new "onGroupSpawn" event type so that admins can define custom strategy chains even for /groupspawn
* many new strategies added, see web strategy doc for full details
* strategy "modes" added, which modify how existing strategies work to provide additional flexbility and control
* changed base command permission to no longer need ".use" suffix. ".use" suffix is deprecated but still works for now.
* new strategies required some small DB schema changes, added additional code to make DB upgrade seamless even for SQLite users
* updated configuration to use Bukkit's new preferred YamlConfiguration classes (hopefully no bugs)
* fixed a bug that prevented groupspawn from working properly
* added a "config_defaults.yml" file which will always contain the most current plugin defaults (for admin's reference)
* new user commands added: /homelist, /deletehome, /setdefaulthome, /homeother
* new op commands added: /sethomeother, /homedeleteother

Because of the Bukkit YamlConfiguration upgrade, HSP 1.0 now requires the Bukkit 1.0 dev builds (I've tested on #1493+). Do NOT try to run this on 1.8 #1337, it will not load.

v0.9.1 - November 26, 2011
* fixed bug ticket #10: /groupspawn not working
* fixed bug ticket #11: /spawn NPE (Vault-related)
* fixed bug ticket #12: /home <player> unintentionally working for everyone

v0.9 - November 12, 2011
* new feature: WorldGuard region-spawn support via "spawnWGregion" strategy
* new feature: Economy fees using optional Vault dependency
* new feature: spawnSpecificWorld strategy
* new feature: spawnNamedSpawn strategy
* new command: /setdefaultspawn to allow for defining the default spawn
out of multiple named spawns that might exist in a world
* new feature: usurpCommands - admin can specify commands s/he wants this
plugin to takeover if other plugins are using it (ie. usurp "/home" from
CommandBook, which loads first alphabetically)
* new feature: implemented "spawnNearest" spawn strategy

v0.8 - September 27, 2011
* changed base permission prefix from 'HomeSpawnPlus' to 'hsp'
* added flexible spawn/home strategies, see default 'config.yml' or documentation
* added warmup capability
* added firstLogin capability for newbie spawning
* conceptual notion of "nearest" spawn/home introduced, strategy not fully
implemented yet
* config options have changed, automatically move old one out of the way and
copy the new default into place
* implemented data backup and restore (use /hsp backup, /hsp restore)
* added Superperms permission nodes
* BUGFIX: fixed problem that prevented sleeping in beds at night
* BUGFIX: fixed a bug that prevented group spawning from working properly

v0.7 - July 17, 2011
* made it so "defaultWorld" is also the default spawn world for new players
* added "core.defaultPermissions" so admins can enable defaultPermissions if
they aren't using a Permission-compatible plugin
* added an option for telling HomeSpawnPlus to track player last logout location
and send them there on next login (if onJoin="default"), instead of letting
default Bukkit track location, which seems to get it wrong sometimes (sends
people to surface or down into lava, etc)

v0.6.2 - July 9, 2011
* Added ability for players to delete their homes (/home delete)
* Fixed multihome spawning

v0.6.1 - July 3, 2011
* Fixed issue with players being mistaken for new and sent back to spawn
whenever they logged in if they had no home set

v0.6 - July 2, 2011
* Added config option for choosing in-memory cache
* Fixed bugs related to in-memory cache
* Fixed a bug with spawning on death using wrong config setting

v0.5.1 - July 1, 2011
* Fixed command cooldowns.
* Fixed some permissions issues

v0.5 - July 1, 2011
* Added support for setting home using a bed
* First public release

v0.4 - Jun 30, 2011
* Added support for visiting other players homes, protected by permissions
* Lots of testing, lots of bug fixes

v0.3
* Added conversion utilities from Essentials and SpawnControl
* Added additional config options for controlling spawn behavior
* Added ability to disable every command just by using config options, to
* allow admins to easily deal with command conflicts with any other plugins

v0.2
* Lots of refactored code to support MySQL backend using Bukkit persistence
* Added YML config files
* Permission 3.0 support

v0.1
* Initial version
